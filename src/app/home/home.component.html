                During quarantine and this most recent pandemic, I have heard and seen the importance
                of small businesses. This series focuses on local small businesses around Pittsburgh. From the
                perspective of interiors/atmosphere – I want the viewer to feel as if they are truly there. And
                when they walk away from each painting, it will leave them with a memory as if they’ve been
                there. My intent is to provide a sense of familiarity, warmth, and comfortability- something
                corporations can’t offer. All in hopes to initiate customers to consider shopping small more often
                or supporting places they otherwise wouldn’t have thought of.
